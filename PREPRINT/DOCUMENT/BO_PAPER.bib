  abstract = {In this paper, we report on the developed and used of finite element methods, have been developed and used for sheet forming simulations since the 1970s, and have immensely contributed to ensure the success of concurrent design in the manufacturing process of sheets metal. During the forming operation, the Gurson\textendash Tvergaard\textendash Needleman (GTN) model was often employed to evaluate the ductile damage and fracture phenomena. GTN represents one of the most widely used ductile damage model. In this investigation, many experimental tests and finite element model computation are performed to predict the damage evolution in notched tensile specimen of sheet metal using the GTN model. The parameters in the GTN model are calibrated using an Artificial Neural Networks system and the results of the tensile test. In the experimental part, we used an optical measurement instruments in two phases: firstly during the tensile test, a digital image correlation method is applied to determinate the full-field displacements in the specimen surface. Secondly a profile projector is employed to evaluate the localization of deformation (formation of shear band) just before the specimen's fracture. In the validation parts of this investigation, the experimental results of hydroforming part and Erichsen test are compared with their numerical finite element model taking into account the GTN model. A good correlation was observed between the two approaches.},

  abstract = {This paper presents a method for the identification of deformation, damage and fracture properties of ductile materials. The small punch test is used to obtain the material response under loading. The resulting load displacement curve contains information about the deformation and failure behavior of the tested material. The finite element method is used to compute the load displacement curve depending on the parameters of the Gurson\textendash Tvergaard\textendash Needleman damage law. Via a systematic variation of the material parameters a data base is built up, which is used to train neural networks. This neural network can be used to predict the load displacement curve of the SPT for a given material parameter set. The identification of the material parameters is done by using a conjugate directions algorithm, which minimizes the error between an experimental load displacement curve and one predicted by the network function. The identified material parameters are validated by independent tests on notched tensile specimens. Furthermore, these parameters can be used to compute the crack growth in fracture specimens, which finally leads to a prediction of classical fracture toughness parameters.},

  abstract = {This book covers both classical and modern models in deep learning. The primary focus is on the theory and algorithms of deep learning. The theory and algorithms of neural networks are particularly important for understanding important concepts, so that one can understand the important design concepts of neural architectures in different applications. Why do neural networks work? When do they work better than off-the-shelf machine-learning models? When is depth useful? Why is training neural networks so hard? What are the pitfalls? The book is also rich in discussing different applications in order to give the practitioner a flavor of how neural architectures are designed for different types of problems. Applications associated with many different areas like recommender systems, machine translation, image captioning, image classification, reinforcement-learning based gaming, and text analytics are covered. The chapters of this book span three categories: The basics of neural networks: Many traditional machine learning models can be understood as special cases of neural networks. An emphasis is placed in the first two chapters on understanding the relationship between traditional machine learning and neural networks. Support vector machines, linear/logistic regression, singular value decomposition, matrix factorization, and recommender systems are shown to be special cases of neural networks. These methods are studied together with recent feature engineering methods like word2vec. Fundamentals of neural networks: A detailed discussion of training and regularization is provided in Chapters 3 and 4. Chapters 5 and 6 present radial-basis function (RBF) networks and restricted Boltzmann machines. Advanced topics in neural networks: Chapters 7 and 8 discuss recurrent neural networks and convolutional neural networks. Several advanced topics like deep reinforcement learning, neural Turing machines, Kohonen self-organizing maps, and generative adversarial networks are introduced in Chapters 9 and 10. The book is written for graduate students, researchers, and practitioners. Numerous exercises are available along with a solution manual to aid in classroom teaching. Where possible, an application-centric view is highlighted in order to provide an understanding of the practical uses of each class of techniques.},

In this work, we investigate different methods of combining machine learning with first principles and test them on a case study of multiphase flowrate estimation in a petroleum production system. However, the methods can be applied to any process engineering system. The results show that by adding physics-based models to machine learning, it is possible not only to improve the performance of the purely black-box machine learning models, but also to make them more transparent and interpretable. We also propose a step-by-step procedure for selecting a method for combining physics and machine learning depending on the process engineering system conditions.},

The equations underlying these models do not admit closed form solutions and hence need to be solved numerically. These numerical procedures are computationally expensive making computational run times associated with numerical optimisation or sampling excessive for the uptake of the models in the clinical practice. To address this issue, we adopt the framework of Bayesian optimisation (BO), which is an efficient statistical technique of global optimisation. BO seeks the optimum of an unknown black-box function by sequentially training a statistical surrogate-model and using it to select the next query point by leveraging the associated exploration-exploitation trade-off. To guarantee that the estimates based on the in vivo data are realistic also for high-pressures, unobservable in vivo, we include a penalty term based on a previously published empirical law developed using ex vivo data. Two case studies based on real data demonstrate that the proposed BO procedure outperforms the state-of-the-art inference algorithm for the HO constitutive law.},

In this study, we present a simple training strategy to improve the classification performance of a DNN. In order to attain our goal, we propose to divide the internal parameter space of the DNN into partitions and optimize these partitions individually. We apply our proposed strategy with the popular L-BFGS optimization algorithm even though it can be applied with any optimization algorithm. We evaluate the performance improvement obtained by using our proposed method by testing it on a number of well-known classification benchmark data sets and by performing statistical analysis procedures on classification results. The DNN classifier trained with the proposed strategy is also compared with the state-of-the-art classifiers to demonstrate its effectiveness. Our classification experiments show that the proposed method significantly enhances the training process of the DNN classifier and yields considerable improvements in the accuracy of the classification results.},

The direct identification of the GTN parameters is not easy and it is time-consuming. The Gurson model is based on micro-mechanical behaviour of ductile fracture, containing void nucleation, growth and coalescence. The most used method to determine the GTN parameters is the combination between the experimental and FEM results but its time consuming as we have to repeat the simulations for many times until the simulation data fits the experimental data in the specimen level (axisymmetric tensile bar and CT specimens), but there are also other methods used to determine the GTN parameters, the aim of these methods is to determine the parameters in a short time as Artificial Neural Network, Hybrid Particle Swarm Optimization, Metallographic Method. In this paper, we determine the GTN parameters for the SENT specimen based on the fracture toughness test of CT specimen. The reason behind choosing the SENT specimen is because it can be a very good representative of the pipe for both uniaxial and biaxial loading conditions. The Results show that the GTN parameters concluded from CT simulations, predict very well the crack initiation and propagation of SENT specimen which confirms the validity of this model.},

Ligand solubility and modulator concentration were found to quantitatively predict the growth of nMOFs with a specific morphology, such as ultrathin two-dimensional film, hexagonal nanoplate, octahedron, cuboctahedron, concave octahedron, or hollow octahedron morphology. With these insights, we use epitaxy growth sequences to design nMOFs of desirable nanostructures with enhanced substrate transport and, hence, increased activities for catalytic olefin hydrogenation. This work highlights new opportunities in using machine learning to guide morphology engineering of nMOFs and other nanomaterials.},

However, it was a heavy and trifle job to determine the unknown parameters of the model because of the large number of them and inefficient identification strategy. In this research, we propose an efficient parameters identification strategy of this new damage model based on machine learning algorithm. This strategy combines resilient back-propagation neuro network with genetic algorithm and simulations were implemented in terms of ABAQUS/Explicit. The same strategy of optimization was also used to reduce simulation time. Damage model parameters of 2024-T3 aluminum alloy were identified from the experimental force-displacement curves of the specimens exhibiting high stress triaxiality and negative triaxiality. The identified parameters were verified by using the test results of the specimens providing low and zero stress triaxialities.},

Estimation of the expected trajectory of a patient's future vital signs can allow us determine the degree of risk of physiological deterioration for that patient. Gaussian processes (GPs) offer a principled means of estimating vital-sign trajectories within a probabilistic framework. The automated estimation of GP parameters in this setting is difficult, due to the (often substantial) variation in physiology between patients, and also due to any changes in physiology that may occur for individual patients. Population-based techniques for fitting models to patient vital-sign data may be inferior compared with patient-specific approaches. We here propose the use of Bayesian optimisation to learn patient-specific models that are effective for estimating future physiological data, based on previously-observed data for the individual patient. We show how patient-specific values of GP hyperparameters may be learned using Bayesian optimisation, based on data observed during the first day of a patient's stay on an acute ward. We then demonstrate the benefit of using such methods in terms of forecasting accuracy for monitoring the patient during their subsequent two days on the ward.},

We introduce two novel \$\textbackslash epsilon\$-greedy acquisition functions. Extensive empirical evaluation of these together with random search, purely exploratory, and purely exploitative search on 10 benchmark problems in 1 to 10 dimensions shows that \$\textbackslash epsilon\$-greedy algorithms are generally at least as effective as conventional acquisition functions (e.g., EI and UCB), particularly with a limited budget. In higher dimensions \$\textbackslash epsilon\$-greedy approaches are shown to have improved performance over conventional approaches. These results are borne out on a real world computational fluid dynamics optimisation problem and a robotics active learning problem.

  abstract = {This thesis develops a method for automatically constructing, visualizing and describing  a large class of models, useful for forecasting and finding structure in domains such  as time series, geological formations, and physical dynamics. These models, based on  Gaussian processes, can capture many types of statistical structure, such as periodicity,  changepoints, additivity, and symmetries. Such structure can be encoded through kernels,  which have historically been hand-chosen by experts. We show how to automate  this task, creating a system that explores an open-ended space of models and reports  the structures discovered.    To automatically construct Gaussian process models, we search over sums and products  of kernels, maximizing the approximate marginal likelihood. We show how any  model in this class can be automatically decomposed into qualitatively different parts,  and how each component can be visualized and described through text. We combine  these results into a procedure that, given a dataset, automatically constructs a model  along with a detailed report containing plots and generated text that illustrate the  structure discovered in the data.    The introductory chapters contain a tutorial showing how to express many types of  structure through kernels, and how adding and multiplying different kernels combines  their properties. Examples also show how symmetric kernels can produce priors over  topological manifolds such as cylinders, toruses, and M\"obius strips, as well as their  higher-dimensional generalizations.    This thesis also explores several extensions to Gaussian process models. First, building  on existing work that relates Gaussian processes and neural nets, we analyze natural  extensions of these models to deep kernels and deep Gaussian processes. Second, we examine  additive Gaussian processes, showing their relation to the regularization method  of dropout. Third, we combine Gaussian processes with the Dirichlet process to produce  the warped mixture model: a Bayesian clustering model having nonparametric cluster  shapes, and a corresponding latent space in which each cluster has an interpretable  parametric form.},

  abstract = {We study the acceleration of the finite element method (FEM) simulations using machine learning (ML) models. Specifically, we replace computationally expensive (parts of) FEM models with efficient ML surrogates. We develop three methods to speed up FEM simulations. The primary difference between these models is their degree of intrusion into the FEM source code. Here, we enumerate them from the most to the least intrusive. In the first contribution, we tackle two bottlenecks of a FEM model equipped with a viscoplastic constitutive equation namely, solving the linear system of equations and evaluating the force vector. To tackle the former, we use a proper orthogonal decomposition (POD) method. And we tackle the latter with a discrete empirical interpolation method (DEIM).We observe that DEIM does not effectively speed up such a highly nonlinear FEM model. As a remedy, we divide the time domain into subdomains using a clustering algorithm. Then we construct a set of DEIM points for each cluster. By doing so, we manage to increase the efficiency of the POD-DEIM scheme. We, however, observe that the POD-DEIM scheme is sometimes unstable. The source of this instability is, to the extent of our knowledge, an open question. In the second contribution, we consider a FE2 scheme. The micro model is a FEM model equipped with a viscoplastic constitutive equation. The evaluation of the micro model is the computational bottleneck in this framework. Therefore, we develop a recurrent neural network as a surrogate for the micro model. In this contribution, we also propose a simple but effective sampling technique to collect stress-strain data points. The RNN model is trained based on this data. We also discuss how the RNN model becomes inaccurate when extrapolating. For these scenarios, we discuss how to improve the RNN by collecting more data and retraining. In the third contribution, we develop a surrogate for the entire FEM simulation of a multi-physics problem. Specifically, we consider the FEM simulation of the electrochemical-mechanical interactions in a Li-ion battery. We propose a variant of the convolutional neural network (CNN), namely the HydraNet. The HydraNet takes the geometry of the battery and predicts all solution fields of the FEM model. Solution fields are either output of the solver or that of the post-processing. The HydraNet accepts inputs in the form of image-like fields. We discuss how to encode the geometry of the battery into a set of image-like fields. We argue that the degree of intrusion of these methods to the FEM source code is inversely related to their industrial applicability. As a result, we believe that the first method (POD-DEIM) will mostly remain an academic contribution, while the other two could have potential industrial applications. The central use case of these methods is in a multi-query application such as uncertainty quantification, design, and real-time simulations.},

  abstract = {This paper presents a novel combination of simulation-based optimisation for the process operation of a physical factory, with an emphasis of understanding how the optimisation results support with design decisions for the evolving system requirements. The study combines a discreteevent simulation (DES) and a Bayesian optimiser. The DES models contain multiple input variables, which can be varied to generate model outputs to help with decision making in stochastic, dynamic environments. To this end, optimising the models output to achieve a maximum or minimum is an integral part of understanding the system performance and guiding design choices. With the absence of a simple (or approximate) mathematical model for describing the system, the simulation models are treated as black-box functions.Sensitivity analysis is a key method for understanding system dynamics of a black-box simulation model. It can be very time consuming and computational expensive, however, when considering complex models with many input variables. Bayesian optimisation (BO) is an attractive alternative which can be used in this context, being sequential and containing self-learning algorithms.In this study we have utilised a model of a manufacturing factory as the optimisation testbed. The model contains many stochastic input variables and operates with day-night shift patterns. A subset of input parameters was optimised in the study, to maximize the factory throughput per day. The optimiser was able to produce good overall throughput results and furthermore, BO results were used to generate charts showing the input-output relationship. This enabled a sensitivity analysis of the factory model, against each of the key parameters used in the optimisation. The results obtained are in line with those observed in practice and helped inform decisions made within the factory. The method deployed here is easily adapted to other models and is easily modifiable for other optimisation techniques.},

  abstract = {This paper introduces the concept of finite element network analysis (FENA) which is a physics-informed, machine-learning-based, computational framework for the simulation of physical systems. The framework leverages the extreme computational speed of trained neural networks and the unique transfer knowledge property of bidirectional recurrent neural networks (BRNN) to provide a uniquely powerful and flexible computing platform. One of the most remarkable properties of this framework consists in its ability to simulate the response of physical systems, made of multiple interconnected components, by combining individually pre-trained network models that do not require any further training following the assembly phase. This remarkable result is achieved via the use of key concepts such as transfer knowledge and network concatenation. Although the computational framework is illustrated and numerically validated for the case of a 1D elastic bar under static loading, the conceptual structure of the framework is extremely general and it suggests potential extensions to a broad spectrum of applications in computational science. The framework is numerically validated against the solution provided by traditional finite element analysis and the results highlight the outstanding performance of this new concept of computational platform.},

The GTN model for ASTM A992 structural steels is calibrated from the experiments performed on axisymmetrically notched tensile specimens. The experiments are designed to obtain a range of stress triaxiality and different fracture initiation locations. The non-uniqueness in the constitutive parameters of the GTN model is illustrated in this study. The choice of a unique set of GTN constitutive parameters is made by choosing the nucleation strain ({$\varepsilon$}N) as a material constant. The process of estimating this material specific nucleation strain is provided. All the other GTN model parameters corresponding to the material specific nucleation strain ({$\varepsilon$}N) are evaluated to best fit the experimental results. The calibrated GTN model is shown to predict the load displacement behaviour, ductility and fracture initiation locations in the notched specimens. The calibrated GTN parameters are used to successfully predict the ductility of structural components: (a) bars with a hole; (b) plate with reduced section and (c) plate with holes; that are typically found in structural engineering applications.},

It is found that both solutions based on regression trees and NNs can provide accurate results for the specific problem, but NN-based solutions outperform regression-tree-based solutions in terms of their simplicity. This example demonstrates that ML solutions are a major improvement over analytical and empirical solutions in terms of both reliable functionality and rapid deployment.

  abstract = {The objective of this work is to investigate the plastic deformation and associated microstructural evolution and damage in a martensitic steel at multiple length scales, using a combination of finite-element (FE) modelling and experimental measurements. A multiscale model is developed to predict damage evolution in the necked region of a uniaxial tensile test specimen. At the macroscale, a von Mises plasticity FE model in conjunction with a Gurson-Tvergaard-Needleman damage model is used to predict the global deformation and damage evolution. A physically-based crystal plasticity model, incorporating a damage variable is used to investigate the microscale plastic deformation behaviour and the changes in crystal orientation under large strains. The model predicts that slip bands form at the onset of plastic deformation and rotate to become almost parallel to the loading direction at large strain. In the necked region, the initially randomly orientated microstructure develops texture, brought about by inelastic deformation and lattice rotation towards the stable [011] orientation. The predicted crystal orientations and misorientation distribution are in good agreement with measurements obtained through electron backscatter diffraction in the centre of the necked region of the tensile test specimens. The experimental and modelling techniques developed in this work can be used to provide information on the evolution of plastic deformation and damage as well as the orientation-dependent crack initiation and microstructural evolution during large deformation of engineering materials.},

However, there is a lack of detailed knowledge in relation to fusion joining techniques for composite materials.

A 33 parametric study is carried out and a robust machine learning model is developed using a hybrid genetic algorithm\textendash artificial neural network (GA\textendash ANN) trained on the experimental data. Bayesian optimisation is employed to determine the most suitable GA\textendash ANN hyperparameters and the resulting GA\textendash ANN surrogate model is exploited to optimise the welding process, where the process performance metrics are LSS, repeatability and joint visual quality.

For this purpose, an incremental physically-based model is proposed for the P91 steel flow behavior. This formulation considers the effects of dynamic recovery (DRV) and dynamic recrystallization (DRX) on the mechanical properties of the material, using only the flow stress, strain rate and temperature as state variables and not the accumulated strain. Therefore, it reproduces accurately the flow stress, work hardening and work softening not only under constant, but also under transient deformation conditions. To accomplish this study, the material is characterised experimentally by means of uniaxial compression tests, conducted at a temperature range of 900\textendash 1270 \textdegree C and at strain rates in the range of 0.005\textendash 10 s-1. Finally, the proposed model is implemented in commercial finite element (FE) software to provide evidence of the performance of the proposed formulation. The experimental compression tests are simulated using the novel model and the well-known Hansel\textendash Spittel formulation. In conclusion, the incremental physically-based model shows accurate results when work softening is present, especially under variable strain-rate deformation conditions. Hence, the present formulation is appropriate for the simulation of the hot-working processes typically conducted at industrial scale.},

Although lots of AI techniques and approaches are available in mechanical engineering, there isn't any survey aiming to review the existing works, systems and applications in the field of fracture mechanics.

After an overview of AI methods, sub-domains of engineering fracture mechanics with respect to the fault and failure analysis are described. The existing works from 1990 to 2016 are analysed and discussed in four categories as sub-domains of fracture mechanics: (a) failure mode and failure mechanism identification, (b) damage and failure detection and diagnosis, (c) fault and error detection, diagnosis and (d) mechanical fracture and fracture parameters. We analyse literature based on a classification of these five AI methods in order to highlight their main concepts and explain how they are applied in these sub-domains of fracture mechanics. Our analysis and discussion in this paper shows the advantages, limitations and research gaps in this field. Finally, perspectives and future research directions are outlined.},

  abstract = {Dissimilar Metal Welds (DMWs) are used in many industries to increase the service life of components. Typically a corrosion resistant material is bonded to the internal surface of a second material, this is often referred to as cladding. This type of composite component provides the desired mechanical properties and corrosion resistance without excessive cost. Structural integrity assessments can be used to estimate the remaining life of critical components but these methods are complicated and results are dependent on factors such as: material properties, defect size, defect location and the direction of defect propagation. The cladding process is generally conducted via welding which results in yield strength residual stresses. The interaction between primary and secondary stresses on crack driving force (CDF) are not well understood, particularly at the interface between multiple materials where the microstructure is not homogeneous. These unknown factors contribute to overly conservative structural integrity assessments. This work investigates the fracture toughness of defects orientated parallel the interface of a dissimilar metal clad weld using experimental and finite element (FE) methods. A nuclear grade austenitic clad ferritic steel was investigated. A fracture toughness test was conducted on a CT specimen and the influence of the materials boundary on crack propagation was examined using digital image correlation (DIC). DIC of the fracture toughness test shows that high amounts of strain exist both in the region immediately surrounding the crack tip and in the ferritic material at the material boundary. Post-test analysis of the specimen showed two defects initiated at the root of the notch on the outer surface of the specimen. One longer notch was found internally. Two-dimensional plane stress and plane strain FE analyses were conducted and compared to the experimental results.},

The role of in-plane and out-of-plane constraint on fracture toughness requires greater understanding, particularly for low strength materials where test data are limited. In this work a structural steel, grade S275, is assessed both experimentally and via computational methods to investigate the role of constraint on fracture toughness. Single edge notch bend (SENB) samples, tested under three point bend conditions, at temperatures within the ductile-to-brittle transition range (+20~\textdegree C to -70~\textdegree C) are presented. Both standard (B=W, B=0.5W) and non-standard (B=0.75W, B=0.25W) bend test geometries are assessed. Here it is shown that the in-plane and out-of-plane constraint parameters are interdependent. Out-of-plane (thickness) constraint trends which are generally accepted to occur under high in-plane conditions are not present when the in-plane constraint is reduced. The amount of ductile tearing incurred during fracture toughness testing is typically greater when both in-plane and out-of-plane constraint is reduced. Thin samples are shown to be more ductile than thicker samples for equivalent in-plane conditions. These findings are relevant to pressurised components operating at low temperatures.},

  abstract = {The propagation of small cracks contributes to the majority of the fatigue lifetime for structural components. Despite significant interest, criteria for the growth of small cracks, in terms of the direction and speed of crack advancement, have not yet been determined. In this work, a new approach to identify the microstructurally small fatigue crack driving force is presented. Bayesian network and machine learning techniques are utilized to identify relevant micromechanical and microstructural variables that influence the direction and rate of the fatigue crack propagation. A multimodal dataset, combining results from a high-resolution 4D experiment of a small crack propagating in situ within a polycrystalline aggregate and crystal plasticity simulations, is used to provide training data. The relevant variables form the basis for analytical expressions thus representing the small crack driving force in terms of a direction and a rate equation. The ability of the proposed expressions to capture the observed experimental behavior is quantified and compared to the results directly from the Bayesian network and from fatigue metrics that are common in the literature. Results indicate that the direction of small crack propagation can be reliably predicted using the proposed analytical model and compares more favorably than other fatigue metrics.},

We demonstrate the optimisation methodology using high hardness armour steels across three types of experiments that induce a wide range of loading conditions: ballistic penetration, rod-on-anvil, and near-field blast deformation. By utilising such a broad range of conditions for the optimisation, the resulting constitutive model parameters are generalised, i.e., applicable across the range of loading conditions encompassed the by those experiments (e.g., stress states, plastic strain magnitudes, strain rates, etc.). Model constants identified using this methodology are demonstrated to provide a generalisable model with superior predictive accuracy than those derived from conventional mechanical characterisation experiments or optimised from a single experimental condition.},

  abstract = {The use of machine learning algorithms frequently involves careful tuning of learning parameters and model hyperparameters. Unfortunately, this tuning is often a ``black art'' requiring expert experience, rules of thumb, or sometimes brute-force search. There is therefore great appeal for automatic approaches that can optimize the performance of any given learning algorithm to the problem at hand. In this work, we consider this problem through the framework of Bayesian optimization, in which a learning algorithm's generalization performance is modeled as a sample from a Gaussian process (GP). We show that certain choices for the nature of the GP, such as the type of kernel and the treatment of its hyperparameters, can play a crucial role in obtaining a good optimizer that can achieve expert-level performance. We describe new algorithms that take into account the variable cost (duration) of learning algorithm experiments and that can leverage the presence of multiple cores for parallel experimentation. We show that these proposed algorithms improve on previous automatic procedures and can reach or surpass human expert-level optimization for many algorithms including Latent Dirichlet Allocation, Structured SVMs and convolutional neural networks.}

As opposed to the simplest flow theory of plasticity with a smooth yield surface, both these material models exhibit shear band instabilities at a realistic level of strain. Initial imperfections are specified in the form of thickness inhomogeneities. A long-wavelength imperfection grows into the well-known necking mode and subsequently, at a sufficiently high local strain level, bands of intense shear deformations develop in the necking region. The location of these shear bands is strongly influenced by the location of small strain concentrations near the surface, induced by various short-wave patterns of initial thickness imperfections. In accord with the non-uniform straining in the neck it is found that the intensity of the localized deformations varies along the bands, and some of the shear bands end inside the material.},

Final material failure by coalescence of voids, at a value of the void volume fraction in accord with experimental and computational results, is incorporated in this constitutive model via the dependence of the yield condition on the void volume fraction. In the analyses the material has no voids initially; but high voidage develops in the centre of the neck where the hydrostatic tension peaks, leading to the formation of a macroscopic crack as the material stress carrying capacity vanishes. The numerically computed crack is approximately plane in the central part of the neck, but closer to the free surface the crack propagates on a zig-zag path, finally forming the cone of the cup-cone fracture. The onset of macroscopic fracture is found to be associated with a sharp ``knee'' on the load deformation curve, as is also observed experimentally, and at this point the reduction in cross-sectional area stops.

Next, the GPR was described concisely together with an implementation of a standard GPR algorithm. Beyond the standard GPR, packages to implement state-of-the-art Gaussian processes algorithms were reviewed.

  abstract = {Over the last decades, light-emitting diodes (LED) have replaced common light bulbs in almost every application, from flashlights in smartphones to automotive headlights. Illuminating nightly streets requires LEDs to emit a light spectrum that is perceived as pure white by the human eye. The power associated with such a white light spectrum is not only distributed over the contributing wavelengths but also over the angles of vision. For many applications, the usable light rays are required to exit the LED in forward direction, namely under small angles to the perpendicular. In this work, we demonstrate that a specifically designed multi-layer thin film on top of a white LED increases the power of pure white light emitted in forward direction. Therefore, the deduced multi-objective optimization problem is reformulated via a real-valued physics-guided objective function that represents the hierarchical structure of our engineering problem. Variants of Bayesian optimization are employed to maximize this non-deterministic objective function based on ray tracing simulations. Eventually, the investigation of optical properties of suitable multi-layer thin films allowed to identify the mechanism behind the increased directionality of white light: angle and wavelength selective filtering causes the multi-layer thin film to play ping pong with rays of light.},

Fracture surfaces of the specimens used in tensile tests were then observed with the use of scanning electron microscope (SEM). Photographs obtained by SEM were subjected to image analysis procedure in order to extract areas representing voids in the picture and calculate their surface fraction as the fragment of the whole picture. Therefore, the void surface fraction in the picture was identified with the fF parameter. The procedure described above allowed to obtain fF = 0.598.

  abstract = {Fracture is one of the most commonly encountered failure modes of engineering materials and structures. Prevention of cracking-induced failure is, therefore, a major concern in structural designs. Computational modeling of fracture constitutes an indispensable tool not only to predict the failure of cracking structures but also to shed insights into understanding the fracture processes of many materials such as concrete, rock, ceramic, metals, and biological soft tissues. This chapter provides an extensive overview of the literature on the so-called phase-field fracture/damage models (PFMs), particularly, for quasi-static and dynamic fracture of brittle and quasi-brittle materials, from the points of view of a computational mechanician. PFMs are the regularized versions of the variational approach to fracture which generalizes Griffith's theory for brittle fracture. They can handle topologically complex fractures such as initiation, intersecting, and branching cracks in both two and three dimensions with a quite straightforward implementation. One of our aims is to justify the gaining popularity of PFMs. To this end, both theoretical and computational aspects are discussed and extensive benchmark problems (for quasi-static and dynamic brittle/cohesive fracture) that are successfully and unsuccessfully solved with PFMs are presented. Unresolved issues for further investigations are also documented.},

The accurate simulation of ductile fracture failure at the micro and macro scale is critical for improving the validity of predicting structural behaviour of HSS cold-formed hollow sections and welded joints. In this study, the ductile failure of the cold-formed S700 material is studied using the GursonTvergaard-Needleman (GTN) damage model. Representative volume element (RVE) models with the void volume fraction (VVF) between 0.1\% and 30\% are employed to investigate the pressure dependency of the deviatoric limit stress. Different load conditions corresponding to different stress triaxiality levels are applied to unit cells with random spherical pores. The inelastic response of the unit cells are analysed, and the parameters q1, q2, and q3 in the GTN yield surface are calibrated. An equation is proposed to determine parameter q1 for different VVFs. The parameters critical VVF fc and final VVF ff are calibrated by the coupon test from the literature. Finally, the calibrated GTN model is validated against notched coupon tests. The finite element (FE) results show good agreement with the experimental results, indicating that the identified GTN model could efficiently predict the behaviour of the cold-formed HSS.},

Featuresets from two different machines are used to examine the performance of two-class normal/fault recognition. The results are compared with a few other methods for fault detection: Artificial neural networks (ANNs) have been used in this field for many years, while support vector machines (SVMs) also offer successful solutions. For ANNs and SVMs, genetic algorithms have been used to do feature selection, which is an inherent function of GP. In all cases, the GP demonstrates performance which equals or betters that of the previous best performing approaches on these data sets.

However, real designs of materials systems involve both qualitative and quantitative design variables representing material compositions, microstructure morphology, and processing conditions. For mixed-variable problems, existing Bayesian Optimization (BO) approaches represent qualitative factors by dummy variables first and then fit a standard Gaussian process (GP) model with numerical variables as the surrogate model. This approach is restrictive theoretically and fails to capture complex correlations between qualitative levels. We present in this paper the integration of a novel latent-variable (LV) approach for mixed-variable GP modeling with the BO framework for materials design. LVGP is a fundamentally different approach that maps qualitative design variables to underlying numerical LV in GP, which has strong physical justification. It provides flexible parameterization and representation of qualitative factors and shows superior modeling accuracy compared to the existing methods. We demonstrate our approach through testing with numerical examples and materials design examples. The chosen materials design examples represent two different scenarios, one on concurrent materials selection and microstructure optimization for optimizing the light absorption of a quasi-random solar cell, and another on combinatorial search of material constitutes for optimal Hybrid Organic-Inorganic Perovskite (HOIP) design. It is found that in all test examples the mapped LVs provide intuitive visualization and substantial insight into the nature and effects of the qualitative factors. Though materials designs are used as examples, the method presented is generic and can be utilized for other mixed variable design optimization problems that involve expensive physics-based simulations.},

The knowledge of continuum damage mechanics was introduced to experimentally determine the development of void volume fraction through an interrupted uniaxial tensile test, by which the three parameters regarding void nucleation were analytically derived. Other parameters in the GTN model were also uniquely determined through a joint use of the chemical composition analysis, the cell model analyses, and the inverse finite element method. Reliability of this novel parameter determination method was verified through failure predictions on both cracked and un-cracked specimens of STPT410.},

  abstract = {L-BFGS-B is a limited-memory algorithm for solving large nonlinear optimization problems subject to simple bounds on the variables. It is intended for problems in which information on the Hessian matrix is difficult to obtain, or for large dense problems. L-BFGS-B can also be used for unconstrained problems and in this case performs similarly to its predessor, algorithm L-BFGS (Harwell routine VA15). The algorithm is implemented in Fortran 77.},
